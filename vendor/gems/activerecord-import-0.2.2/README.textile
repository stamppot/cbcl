h1. activerecord-import

activerecord-import is a library for bulk inserting data using ActiveRecord. 

h2. Why activerecord-import?

Because plain-vanilla, out-of-the-box ActiveRecord doesn't provide support for inserting large amounts of data efficiently. With vanilla ActiveRecord you would have to perform individual save operations on each model:

<pre>
10.times do |i|
  Book.create! :name => "book #{i}"
end
</pre> 

This may work fine if all you have is 10 records, but if you have hundreds, thousands, or millions of records it can turn into a nightmare. This is where activerecord-import comes into play. 

h2. An Introductory Example

Here's an example with equivalent behaviour using the @#import@ method:

<pre>
books = []
10.times do |i| 
  books << Book.new(:name => "book #{i}")
end
Book.import books
</pre>

This call to import does whatever is most efficient for the underlying database adapter.  Pretty slick, eh?

h2. Features

Here's a list of some of the high-level features that activerecord-import provides:

* activerecord-import can work with raw columns and arrays of values (fastest)
* activerecord-import works with model objects (faster)
* activerecord-import can perform validations (fast)
* activerecord-import can perform on duplicate key updates (requires mysql)


h1. Upgrading from ar-extensions

activerecord-import replaces the ar-extensions library and is compatible with Rails 3. It provides the exact same API for importing data, but it does not include any additional ar-extensions functionality.
